In the pursuit of long-term goals, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task. However, one effective strategy that has been found to bolster success is setting what we'll call 'cumulative goals.' These are goals centered around committing to a certain action a set number of times over a long period, say, a year.

Consider a fitness enthusiast planning to enhance their weightlifting performance. Instead of setting a vague objective like 'become stronger,' they might set a cumulative goal: perform a specific weightlifting routine, say, 100 or 150 times in a year. Each session contributes to their overall strength goal, and reaching the targeted number becomes an achievement in itself.

This strategy isn't just for fitness; it's applicable to any goal that benefits from repetition and consistency. It could be practicing a musical instrument, learning a new language, writing, painting, or even meditating. The essence lies in repetition, in committing to a practice a certain number of times.

By setting a cumulative goal, you create a clear path to your overall objective. Each completed action is a step forward, a tangible sign of progress. This not only allows you to track your progress effectively but also provides regular boosts of motivation and satisfaction.

In addition, such goals imbue a sense of urgency and challenge. Every day becomes an opportunity to tick off one more repetition, to move one step closer to your target. This prevents procrastination and fosters a consistent commitment to your goal.

One may wonder, how can one keep track of such a large number of repetitions, especially when spread over a year? A reliable tracking tool is needed to make this strategy effective, and that's where the Internalize app comes into play.
